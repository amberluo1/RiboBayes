\title{Plot violin plots to visualize the distribution of t-statistics for pause site significance.}
\usage{
plot_ps_regulation(sites)
}
\arguments{
\item{sites}{List of ribosome pause sites; usually the output of \code{get_pause_sites()}}
}
\value{
A \code{ggstatsplot} figure with two violin plots: one showing the distribution of pause site
t-statistics for constant pause sites only (p>0.05) and one showing the distribution of pause
site t-statistics of differential pause sites only (p<=0.05).
}
\description{
Takes as input a list of ribosome pause sites (the output of \code{get_pause_sites()}) and plots
two violin plots showing the distribution of t-statistics for constant and differential pause sites.
